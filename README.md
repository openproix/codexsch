# codexsch

This repository contains a simple homepage (index.html) and a description file.

The project now includes a short guide to learning Linux, available both on the homepage and in `description.md`.

## Deployment

To view the homepage locally, you can start a small HTTP server:

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
